            “Rails is the most well thought-out web development framework I’ve ever used.
            And that’s in a decade of doing web applications for a living. I’ve built my
            own frameworks, helped develop the Servlet API, and have created more than
            a few web servers from scratch. Nobody has done it like this before.”

            “Ruby on Rails is a breakthrough in lowering the barriers of entry to programming.
            Powerful web applications that formerly might have taken weeks or months
            to develop can be produced in a matter of days.”

            “It is impossible not to notice Ruby on Rails.  It has had a huge effect both in
            and outside the Ruby community... Rails has become a standard to which even
            well-established tools are comparing themselves to.”

            “What sets this framework apart from all of the others is the preference for
            convention over configuration making applications easier
            to develop and understand.”

            Now, web designers and software engineers can develop a website
            much faster and more simply, enabling them to be more productive
            and effective in their work.”
