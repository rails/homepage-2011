          <strong>David Heinemeier Hansson</strong> extracted Ruby on Rails from his
          work on <a href="http://www.basecamp.com" title="Basecamp: Project management app">Basecamp</a>. He released the
          framework as open source in July of 2004, but didn’t share the commit rights
          until February of 2005. He’s infamous for his ruthless delegation, which is
          often executed as a request to “Please Do Investigate”. He’s a partner at
