              is a language enthusiast who went from being a literature major to a programmer.  In his transition from
              natural language to machine language he found Ruby an elegant balance of
              dynamic, pragmatic and “humane”.  And then came along Rails… Marcel works at

              encountered Rails while struggling to find technology for his new company.
              Once found, he quickly ported the bits and pieces of his code over to Ruby which later became
              the first rails based e-commerce store “Snowdevil”. Tobi is a partner at <a href="http://jadedpixel.com/" title="JadedPixel official site">JadedPixel</a> and is
              frantically working on <a href="http://shopify.com/" title="E-commerce platform">Shopify</a> which is the continuation of the Snowdevil code base.
              Over time, Tobi released many open source projects such as <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com/" Title="Typo official site">Typo</a>, <a href="http://www.hieraki.org/" Title="Hieraki website">Hieraki</a>,
