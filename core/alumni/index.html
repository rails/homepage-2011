          <strong>Marcel Molina Jr. (noradio)</strong> is a language enthusiast
          who went from being a literature major to a programmer.  In his transition from
          natural language to machine language he found Ruby an elegant balance of
          dynamic, pragmatic and “humane”.  And then came along Rails… Marcel works at
          <a href="http://twitter.com/">twitter</a> and tumblelogs at <a href="http://project.ioni.st/">Projectionist</a>.
