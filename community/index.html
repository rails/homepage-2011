          Sometimes it’s just easier to get help or <mark>discuss matters
          in real time</mark>. The <em>#rubyonrails</em> channel on <em>irc.freenode.net</em>
          allows for just that. Try <em>#rails-contrib</em> if you want help or discuss your
          patch to Rails itself. You can also join the <a href="https://rubyoss-slackin.herokuapp.com">Ruby Community Slack team</a> to chat with fellow Rubyists.
