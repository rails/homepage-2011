        <h2>Mailing lists</h2>
        <p>
		  <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-talk">Ruby on Rails Talk</a> is where Rails users come to <span class="highlight">seek help, announce projects, and discuss</span> all kind of matters surrounding the framework and the community. If you're working on a patch, you can raise issues on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-core">the core list<a/>. We also have a dedicated <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/prototype-scriptaculous">list for Script.aculo.us and Prototype talk</a> on Javascript and Ajax. Finally, there's the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security">security announcement list</a> for critical patches.

        <h2>Wiki</h2>
        <p>
		  <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/">The Rails wiki</a> is the sprawling, weird, and wonderful pot of <span class="highlight">user contributions to the documentation</span> and the Rails knowledge sphere. If you can't find something in the books or official guides, there's a good chance you can find it here.

        <h2>IRC</h2>
        <p>
		  Sometimes its just easier to get help or <span class="highlight">discuss matters in real time</span>. The #rubyonrails channel on irc.freenode.net allows for just that. Try #rails-contrib if you want help or discuss your patch to Rails itself. <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/IRC">Need an IRC client?</a>
