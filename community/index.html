          <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-talk">Ruby
          on Rails Talk</a> is where Rails users come to <span class="highlight">seek help,
          announce projects, and discuss</span> all kind of matters surrounding the
          framework and the community. If you're working on a patch, you can raise issues
          on <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/rubyonrails-core">
          the core list</a>. We also have a dedicated <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/prototype-scriptaculous">
          list for Script.aculo.us and Prototype talk</a> on Javascript and Ajax. Finally,
          there's the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-security">security
          announcement list</a> for critical patches.

        <h2>IRC</h2>
        <p>
          Sometimes its just easier to get help or <span class="highlight">discuss
          matters in real time</span>. The #rubyonrails channel on irc.freenode.net
          allows for just that. Try #rails-contrib if you want help or discuss your
          patch to Rails itself.
