        <p>
          Sometimes it’s just easier to get help or <span class="highlight">discuss matters
          in real time</span>. The <em>#rubyonrails</em> channel on <em>irc.freenode.net</em>
          allows for just that. Try <em>#rails-contrib</em> if you want help or discuss your
          patch to Rails itself.
